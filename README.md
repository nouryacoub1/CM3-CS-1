#### Video Demo: [Click Here](<YOUR VIDEO URL>)

## 📌 Description
The Task Manager CLI is a command-line application that allows users to **add, remove, and list tasks**. It stores tasks persistently in a **JSON file** so that tasks are not lost when the program is closed. This project demonstrates **file handling, functions, and testing with Pytest**.

The application provides a **simple, intuitive interface** where users can:
- Add tasks 📌
- Remove tasks 🗑
- List all tasks 📋
- Persist data across sessions using `tasks.json`

## 📌 Features
✅ **Add Task** - Users can add new tasks via command-line input.  
✅ **Remove Task** - Users can delete tasks by specifying the task name.  
✅ **List Tasks** - Displays all stored tasks in a numbered list.  
✅ **Persistent Storage** - Uses `tasks.json` to store tasks permanently.
